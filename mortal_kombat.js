        "about" : "Kotal Kahn is a warrior from the realm of Osh-Tekk, which was once ruled by Kotal K'etz, his father, but was later merged into Outworld by conquest. After the death of his father, he became the last of his kind. He would eventually usurp Mileena as emperor of Outworld due to his popularity and charisma.Unlike previous Outworld emperors, Kotal Kahn is uninterested in conquering other realms, preferring instead to focus on internal affairs and stabilizing the realm. For this reason, he is strongly opposed to liberating realms that are already under Outworld's domain, believing that a united Outworld would prove stronger against its enemies. He also bears no hatred for Earthrealm or its inhabitants, and has willingly cooperated with them on several occasions, although he is shown to be distrustful of Raiden.At some point in history, he journeyed throughout Earthrealm and encountered the Mayan civilization, wherein he came to be considered a hero after driving off invading Spanish conquistadors. The Mayans named him Buluc Chabtan, their god of war. In his honor, the Mayans began emulating his penchant for consuming blood. However, this caused the Mayans to contract blood disease, killing thousands. In horror and shame, Kotal left the Mayans and returned to Outworld."
